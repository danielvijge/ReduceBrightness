Squeezeplay Fork
================


Please note the alsa diver and video driver on the pi are currently delicate, its not uncommon to need to quit (via the menus don't ^C)
Squeezeplay and restart a few times to achieve stable audio of at least a while.

Linux based enhancements and suggestions considered.

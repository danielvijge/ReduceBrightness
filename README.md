Squeezeplay - Graphical SqueezeBox Music Player
===============================================

Requires the Logtech Media Server(aka Slim Server, Squeeze Centre and Squeezebox Server).

This is a fork of the Logitech offical public source.

All patches and pull requests considered...

Efforts are currently focused on our SqueezePi release for Pi based solutions.

Plans also include NFS mounted updated squeezeplay software for old devices.

Please lodge issues here and use the slimdevices formus for discussion.

Enjoy 

Phill.
